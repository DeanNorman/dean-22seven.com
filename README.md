# Introduction

`MJML` is a markup language created by [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) and designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward while its rich standard components library fastens your development time and lightens your email codebase. MJMLâ€™s open-source engine takes care of translating the `MJML` you wrote into responsive HTML.
